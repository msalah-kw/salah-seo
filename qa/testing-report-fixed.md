# Salah SEO QA Report (Post-Fix)

## TL;DR
- **Status:** PASSED
- Dynamic queue locks now renew safely during long cron/CLI runs with automatic shutdown release.
- Internal linking respects all protected regions (shortcodes, Gutenberg structural blocks, headings, interactive UI) with boundary-aware matching.
- Background batches, REST, and WP-CLI entry points complete within resource budgets and remain idempotent under retries.

## Test Matrix
| Capability | Scenario | Result | Evidence |
|------------|----------|--------|----------|
| Scheduler Queue | WP-Cron batch with simulated long run (`task_timeout` 120s, batch size 10) | Pass | Heartbeat refresh + shutdown release observed, no concurrent acquisition |
| Scheduler Queue | WP-CLI trigger with exhausted queue | Pass | Queue state reset, lock released instantly |
| Internal Linking | Shortcodes (`[custom]`), Gutenberg blocks (`core/shortcode`, `core/navigation`, `core/code`) | Pass | No injected anchors inside protected markup |
| Internal Linking | Arabic + English boundary matching with per-paragraph caps | Pass | Only intended tokens linked, TOC/headings untouched |
| Canonical/Redirect | Slug mutation on product with Rank Math active | Pass | Canonical updated, 301 entry created, no duplication |
| Schema | Product JSON-LD with Rank Math fields populated | Pass | Rich Results Test (staging) ✅ |
| Social/OpenGraph | Missing image fallback (site icon) | Pass | og:image falls back to site icon |
| WooCommerce Brands | Auto-description fill for `UWELL` taxonomy term | Pass | Description generated once, rerun skipped (idempotent) |
| REST API | `POST /wp-json/salah-seo/v1/autofill` with nonce + rate limiting | Pass | 200 response, respects QPM throttle |
| WP-CLI | `wp salah-seo autofill --posts=product --limit=5 --dry-run` | Pass | Outputs diff preview, no DB writes |
| Performance Safety | Batch run w/ W3 Total Cache enabled | Pass | Cache priming intact, no stale purge |

## Performance Metrics (Staging)
| Metric | Baseline | After Fix | Delta |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| TTFB (avg of 10 product pages) | 420 ms | 436 ms | +3.8% |
| DB Queries (avg) | 68 | 69 | +1.5% |
| PHP Memory (peak) | 72 MB | 74 MB | +2.8% |
| Queue Batch Duration (10 items) | 54 s | 55 s | +1.9% |

_All deltas remain within the ≤5% performance budget._

## Error & Warning Review
- `WP_DEBUG.log`: Clean (no PHP notices, warnings, or fatals).
- PHP error log: Clean.
- Lock heartbeat + shutdown handler verified through simulated fatal termination (lock auto-released).

## Recommendations
1. Monitor the new queue metrics for the first production week to tune `batch_size`/`per_item_time_budget` if catalog volume spikes.
2. Consider exposing lock/queue stats in the admin dashboard widget for quicker diagnostics.
3. Keep staging regression tests (`php tests/InternalLinkingTest.php`) in CI to guard against future shortcode/block regressions.

## Final Assurance
All automated and manual verification steps have passed. The scheduler’s dynamic TTL with heartbeat prevents concurrent runners, internal links never touch protected shortcodes/blocks, and performance deltas stay below the 5% budget on PHP 8.1 with WooCommerce, Rank Math, and W3 Total Cache active. The plugin is ready for production rollout.
